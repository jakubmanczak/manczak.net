I'm 19 years old and, somehow, still don't know what to do with myself. I say that – _somehow_ – as if it wasn't the greatest cliché you could embody
as a person finishing your national equivalent of a high school, but it's a cliché for a reason, I think. When leaving the 8 year primary school,
all I knew was that I'm kind of okay at computers, and that I'd like to pursue that as a career somehow. I saw the prospect of a technical school
and a diploma of "IT Technician" as worthy of the additional year spent in school, not to mention the twice as long school days.

<br />

But having gone through it, would I still pick the same path? Part of me wants to say no. I now know that the value of an IT technician diploma is next
to null when it comes to programming jobs, that's one reason. A technical school is part of our national system, and for the sake of keeping our
rates of education up, people are allowed to pass that never should. The stereotypical holder of such a certificate knows very little about the things
he's certified to do – whether it be networking, systems, databases or programming. These diplomas are made for people to be hired as technicians,
as the name implies. For people to sit in a backroom of a production line building and maintain the computers which aid the ill-paid workers. You can't
expect to be given a remote work-from-home job writing code from a MacBook because _you have a government cert._ They will laugh at you.

<br />

Though, then again, I was a completely different person coming here than leaving. I was timid and shy, doubtless caused by the environment of my
primary school. You could say that, in a way, this school, or rather the people in it, cured me. There is much talk of how my generation doesn't know
how to socialise with each other, and how it doesn't bond in their class environments. Out of the four graduating classes this year, you could plainly
see that we were the most proactive and most friendly. Our main teacher was the only one that cried at the thought of telling us goodbye. What if I had
landed in a different class? One less proactive, one less inviting, one riddled with drama and infighting? Would they have cured me? I'd wager they wouldn't.
And where would I be now, following such a scenario?

<br />

That's an awful lot of thinking about the past for someone in such a pivotal moment of their life. How about the future? The IT industry is perceived to be
a pot of gold for those looking to make a quick buck. There's a load of people trying to get in, people who somehow don't know what a directory is, yet are
banking on the mythical ever increasing demand for programmers. Meanwhile, I've been coding as a hobby for the past 5 years. Compared to such individuals,
I have some strong foundational knowledge when it comes to IT. I've been working on MacOS for 9 months, prior to which I used Linux (which I'm **not** going to
call GNU+Linux), first parallel with Windows, and later on exclusively. I am fluent in terminal, whether it be bash or zsh. I have _some_ experience with
coding in C, and with building and linking C projects. I've delved into Assembly a few times. I'm learning Rust. But I also fw higher levels of abstractions,
having made a battle tested oxford debate clock that was heavily in use by the school debate league and the national tournament in oxford debate in english.
That was done with React. And there's more to do with debates – surely, it will prove my worth. Right?

<br />

The typical path ahead is to go to what the Americans call college. Attain a higher education. I think it's a fitting path. I don't like the sound of forever
being labeled with **wykształcenie średnie**. I'd like to think of myself as a conscious, aware citizen, and even though there's nothing wrong with putting
education aside in favor of working, it would certainly stifle some sense of pride I undeservingly exhibit. So what's the play? Where do I go?

<br />

I like it here in Poznań. Even though I could probably try to get accepted into _Uni_ abroad, I find it needless. The prestige these universities offer is
a really bad deal if, as a foreigner, you have to pay for it like the Americans do in the US. So, I'm probably staying here. There's a polytechnic university
here, but not really feeling like studying the same IT for the same amount of time in the same kind of environment as my high school, I hadn't focused on Maths
enough to be able to get in. So how about the 3rd largest University in Poland? UAM – they have everything. I was initially thinking about linguistics, and studying
English - but **literally everyone** told me not to. Fine. My brother convinced me to try to get into Cognitive Science. It's supposedly part linguistics, part
computers and part psychology. I can try, I suppose.

<br />

I'd like to try and write more. But I really, truly don't know more. What do I do and where do I go? Who knows. Let's hope I find something to do,
and that I manage to avoid drifting in-between states of belonging like some demented lunatic.

<br />

How do I end a blog post?

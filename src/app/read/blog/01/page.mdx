I'm 19 years old and, somehow, still don't know what to do with myself. I say that word – _somehow_ – as if it wasn't the greatest cliché you could embody
as a person finishing your national equivalent of a high school, but I think it's a cliché for a reason. When leaving the 8-year primary school,
all I knew was that I was kind of okay at computers and that I'd like to pursue that as a career somehow. I saw the prospect of a technical school
and a diploma of "IT Technician" as worthy of the additional year spent in school, not to mention the twice as long school days.

<br />

But having gone through it, would I still pick the same path? Part of me wants to say no. I now know that the value of an IT technician diploma is next
to null when it comes to programming jobs, that's one reason. A technical school is part of our national system, and for the sake of letting people
graduate, diplomas are given to people who did not learn the skills they are certified to have. The mean holder of such a certificate knows very little about
the things he's certified to be able to do – whether it be networking, systems, databases or programming. These diplomas are made for people to be hired
as technicians, as the name implies. For people to sit in the backroom of a production line building and maintain the computers which aid the ill-paid workers.
You can't expect to be given a remote work-from-home job writing code from a MacBook because you _have a government cert_. They will laugh at you.

<br />

However, I was a completely different person coming here than leaving. I was timid and shy, doubtless caused by the environment of my
primary school. And I did not want to be that way - but knew nothing more. You could say that, in a way, this school, or rather the people in it,
cured me. There is much talk of how my generation doesn't know how to socialise with each other, and how it doesn't bond in their class environments.
Out of the four graduating classes this year, you could plainly see that we were the most proactive and most friendly. Our main teacher was the only one
who cried at the thought of telling us goodbye. What if I had landed in a different class? One less proactive, one less inviting, one riddled with drama
and infighting? Would they have cured me? I'd wager they wouldn't. And where would I be now, following such a scenario?

<br />

That's an awful lot of thinking about the past for someone in such a pivotal moment of their life. How about the future? The IT industry is perceived to be
a pot of gold for those looking to make a quick buck. There's a load of people trying to get in, people who somehow don't know what a directory is, yet are
banking on the mythical ever-increasing demand for programmers. Meanwhile, I've been coding as a hobby for the past 5 years. Compared to such individuals,
I have some strong foundational knowledge when it comes to IT. Across those years I've used each major OS. I've been working on MacOS for the past 9 months,
before which I used Linux (which I'm **not** going to call GNU+Linux) for 3 years, first parallel with Windows, and later on exclusively. I am fluent in terminal,
whether it be bash or zsh. I have moderate experience with C. I've delved into Assembly a few times. I'm learning Rust. But I also fw higher levels of abstractions,
having made a battle-tested oxford debate clock that was heavily in use by the school debate league and a national tournament in oxford debate in English.
That was done with React. And there's more to do with oxford debates, as there are many aspects of a debate organiser's life left to simplify with code and
information technology. There are no big databases of motions. There isn't a definitive index of debate tournaments held in the country. And perhaps most importantly,
there isn't a single coherent system that could aid someone in conducting a debate tournament without making a mess of Excel formulas and a lot of paper usage.

Surely, fixing some of that will prove my worth as a programmer. Right?

<br />

The typical path ahead is to go to what the Americans call college. To attain a higher education. And I think this kind of path forward fits me.
I don't like the sound of forever being labelled with **wykształcenie średnie**. I'd like to think of myself as a conscious, aware citizen, and even
though there's nothing wrong with putting education aside in favour of working, it would certainly stifle some sense of pride I undeservingly exhibit.
So what's the play? Where do I go?

<br />

I like it here in Poznań. Even though I could probably get accepted into some _Universities_ abroad, I feel no need to try. The prestige these universities offer is
a really bad deal if, as a foreigner, you have to pay for it like the Americans do in the US. And life abroad is more expensive, too. And what for? The same information
I can learn from the same books in Poland. I'm probably staying here. There's a polytechnic university in Poznań, but as I wasn't really feeling like studying the same IT
material for the same amount of time in the same kind of environment as my high school, I hadn't focused on Maths enough to be able to get in. So how about the 3rd largest
university in Poland? UAM – they have everything. I was initially thinking about linguistics, and studying English - but **literally everyone** told me not to. Fine.
My brother convinced me to try to get into Cognitive Science. It's supposedly part linguistics, part computers and part psychology. Sounds interesting. I can try, I suppose.

<br />

I'd like to try and write more on this. But I really, truly don't have many more thoughts on this. What do I do and where do I go? Who knows? I sure don't.
All I can do is hope I find out, and that I manage to avoid drifting in-between states of belonging like some demented lunatic in the process.
